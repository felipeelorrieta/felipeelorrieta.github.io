  abstract  = {Objective This study aims to develop an algorithm to detect steatotic liver disease (SLD) risk in low-resource settings without requiring imaging. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 826 measurements from 444 participants aged 45--60 years who participated in the MAUCO+ study. Data included ultrasound, vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), anthropometrics and biomarkers. Logistic multivariable regression was used to develop two predictive models for SLD risk, with and without ultrasound, using VCTE as gold standard. Missing data were minimal and retained in the analysis, as their proportion was not statistically relevant. Predictive performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) was compared with the clinically used Fatty Liver Index (FLI). Results The algorithm without ultrasound achieved a sensitivity of 81.1\% (95\% CI 71.7\% to 88.4\%) and specificity of 71.4\% (95\% CI 57.9\% to 80.4\%). The model with ultrasound demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.5\% (95\% CI 84.1\% to 95.6\%) and specificity of 70\% (95\% CI 59.9\% to 80.7\%). FLI showed an AUC of 0.762, while our models achieved higher AUCs: 0.878 (with ultrasound) and 0.794 (without ultrasound). Discussion Our models offer screening tools for SLD in low-resource primary care. The model without ultrasound outperformed FLI, making it a feasible alternative where imaging is unavailable. The ultrasound-based model demonstrated higher performance, underscoring the value of ultrasound when it is accessible. Conclusions We developed two predictive models for SLD screening in a Chilean cohort, with strong performance and potential for implementation in primary care.},

    abstract = {Personal protective measures such use of face masks, hand washing and physical distancing have proven to be effective in controlling the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, adherence to these measures may have been relaxed over time. The objective of this work is to assess the change in adherence to these measures and to find factors that explain the change For this purpose, we conducted a survey in the Metropolitan Region of Chile in which we asked the adherence to these measures in August-September 2021 and retrospectively for 2020. With the answers obtained we fit a logistic regression model in which the response variable is the relaxation of each of the self-care preventive actions. The explanatory variables used are socio-demographic characteristics such as the age, sex, income, and vaccination status of the respondents. The results obtained show that there has been a significant decrease in adherence to the three personal protection measures in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. In addition, it was observed that younger people are more likely to relax these measures. The results show the importance of generating new incentives for maintaining adherence to personal protection measures.},

  abstract  = {Several studies have shown that, in Chile, income inequality is relevant in explaining health inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a negative impact, with higher mortality rates in those municipalities of Greater Santiago with lower socioeconomic status. We study inequity in mortality based on Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) in 34 urban municipalities of the Metropolitan Region (Greater Santiago) and analyze its evolution between 2018 and 2021 and by COVID-19 waves. To compare the results obtained for PYLL, we also computed the mortality rates adjusted by direct standardization. In addition, we used the concentration index (CI) to measure the health inequalities between municipalities. In the first year of the pandemic, the absolute PYLL and the standardized mortality rate for all causes of death showed an increase of 13.6\% and 18.9\%, respectively. Moreover, 409,086 years of life were prematurely lost in 2020, one-fifth of them due to COVID-19. The concentration indices confirm inequality in both mortality rates and PYLL, where it is more pronounced when calculating the latter measure. Results show that the deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected the most economically disadvantaged municipalities, and particularly young people in those places.}
