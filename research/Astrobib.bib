	title = {The Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events ({ALeRCE}) Alert Broker},
	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {We introduce the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker, an astronomical alert broker designed to provide a rapid and self-consistent classification of large etendue telescope alert streams, such as that provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and, in the future, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). ALeRCE is a Chilean-led broker run by an interdisciplinary team of astronomers and engineers working to become intermediaries between survey and follow-up facilities. ALeRCE uses a pipeline that includes the real-time ingestion, aggregation, cross-matching, machine-learning (ML) classification, and visualization of the ZTF alert stream. We use two classifiers: a stamp-based classifier, designed for rapid classification, and a light curve–based classifier, which uses the multiband flux evolution to achieve a more refined classification. We describe in detail our pipeline, data products, tools, and services, which are made public for the community (see https://alerce.science). Since we began operating our real-time ML classification of the ZTF alert stream in early 2019, we have grown a large community of active users around the globe. We describe our results to date, including the real-time processing of 1.5 × 108 alerts, the stamp classification of 3.4 × 107 objects, the light-curve classification of 1.1 × 106 objects, the report of 6162 supernova candidates, and different experiments using LSST-like alert streams. Finally, we discuss the challenges ahead in going from a single stream of alerts such as ZTF to a multistream ecosystem dominated by LSST.}

    abstract = "{In several disciplines, it is common to find time series measured at irregular observational times. In particular, in astronomy there are a large number of surveys that gather information over irregular time gaps and in more than one passband. Some examples are Pan-STARRS, ZTF, and also the LSST. However, current commonly used time series models that estimate the time dependence in astronomical light curves consider the information of each band separately (e.g, CIAR, IAR, and CARMA models) disregarding the dependence that might exist between different passbands. In this paper, we propose a novel bivariate model for irregularly sampled time series, called the Bivariate Irregular Autoregressive (BIAR) model. The BIAR model assumes an autoregressive structure on each time series; it is stationary, and it allows to estimate the autocorrelation, the cross-correlation and the contemporary correlation between two unequally spaced time series. We implemented the BIAR model on light curves, in the g and r bands, obtained from the ZTF alerts processed by the ALeRCE broker. We show that if the light curves of the two bands are highly correlated, the model has more accurate forecast and prediction using the bivariate model than a similar method that uses only univariate information. Further, the estimated parameters of the BIAR are useful to characterize long-period variable stars and to distinguish between classes of stochastic objects, providing promising features that can be used for classification purposes.}",

    abstract = "{Time series observations are ubiquitous in astronomy and are generated, for example, to distinguish between different types of supernovae to detect and characterize extrasolar planets and to classify variable stars. These time series are usually modelled using a parametric and/or physical model that assumes independent and homoscedastic errors, but in many cases, these assumptions are not accurate and there remains a temporal dependence structure on the errors. This can occur, for example, when the proposed model cannot explain all the variability of the data or when the parameters of the model are not properly estimated. In this work, we define an autoregressive model for irregular discrete-time series based on the discrete time representation of the continuous autoregressive model of order 1. We show that the model is ergodic and stationary. We further propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure and assess the finite sample performance by Monte Carlo simulations. We implement the model on real and simulated data from Gaussian as well as other distributions, showing that the model can flexibly adapt to different data distributions. We apply the irregular autoregressive model to the residuals of a transit of an extrasolar planet to illustrate errors that remain with temporal structure. We also apply this model to residuals of an harmonic fit of light curves from variable stars to illustrate how the model can be used to detect incorrect parameter estimation.}",

	abstract = {We present the first version of the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker light curve classifier. ALeRCE is currently processing the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The ALeRCE light curve classifier uses variability features computed from the ZTF alert stream and colors obtained from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. We apply a balanced random forest algorithm with a two-level scheme where the top level classifies each source as periodic, stochastic, or transient, and the bottom level further resolves each of these hierarchical classes among 15 total classes. This classifier corresponds to the first attempt to classify multiple classes of stochastic variables (including core- and host-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, young stellar objects, and cataclysmic variables) in addition to different classes of periodic and transient sources, using real data. We created a labeled set using various public catalogs (such as the Catalina Surveys and Gaia DR2 variable stars catalogs, and the Million Quasars catalog), and we classify all objects with ≥6 g-band or ≥6 r-band detections in ZTF (868,371 sources as of 2020 June 9), providing updated classifications for sources with new alerts every day. For the top level we obtain macro-averaged precision and recall scores of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, and for the bottom level we obtain macro-averaged precision and recall scores of 0.57 and 0.76, respectively. Updated classifications from the light curve classifier can be found at the ALeRCE Explorer website (http://alerce.online).}}

abstract="In the last decades, due to the huge technological growth observed, it has become increasingly common that a collection of temporal data rapidly accumulates in vast amounts. This provides an opportunity for extracting valuable information through the estimation of increasingly precise models. But at the same time, it imposes the challenge of continuously updating the models as new data become available. Currently available methods for addressing this problem, the so-called online learning methods, use current parameter estimations and novel data to update the estimators. These approaches avoid using the full raw data and speeding up the computations. In this work, we consider three online learning algorithms for parameters estimation in the context of time series models. In particular, the methods implemented are gradient descent, Newton-step and Kalman filter recursions. These algorithms are applied to the recently developed irregularly observed autoregressive (iAR) model. The estimation accuracy of the proposed methods is assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments. The results obtained show that the proposed online estimation methods allow for a precise estimation of the parameters that generate the data both for the regularly and irregularly observed time series. These online approaches are numerically efficient, allowing substantial computational time savings. Moreover, we show that the proposed methods are able to adapt the parameter estimates quickly when the time series behavior changes, unlike batch estimation methods.",isbn="978-3-031-40209-8"}
